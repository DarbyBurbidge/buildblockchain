# This is a repo containing the code built from working through the book "Learn Blockchain by Building One" by Daniel van Flymen

### This is only somewhat my code as the book provides a massive amount of the code
(although much of the code for chapter 7 is missing from the book)

This repo is primarily intended as practice for using git/hub as well as lookup for when I forget certain things and is not intended to be an example of my ability to code.

Thank you, Darby
